								<h1>DRACONAUT | 50</h1>
								<p>In basic they taught us one simple truth: one dragon has the power to decimate a whole continent if just one of its eggs is threatened and it rages. </p>
								<p>Panic set in as I watched from my parachute the fire from my downed fighter set a clutch of thousand ablaze. </p>

								<h2 class="major">YELLOW SWORD | 100</h2>
								<!-- <span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
								<p>The kingdom's villages sent tributes into the wilderness on the annual journey to the capital city. 
									<br>
									<br>Audience with the king would be the reward for whoever eluded the knights of the realm which hunted them in the traditions of old.
									<br>
									<br>I had found the one that stalked me, his armor bejeweled and glistening in the light of the fire of my torch as we dueled.
									<br>
									<br>After hours I finally felled the bastard. Afterwards I didn't know what was more peculiar: the yellow blood that adorned my sword or the black tentacles coming from the helm, feet from where the rest laid. </p>
								<h2 class="major">IN GOOD COMPANY | 50</h2>
								<!-- <span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
								<p>The Golden Palace was deserted. Along with all the dwellings and abodes that littered the planet wide city of Or.
									<br>
									<br>For a millennia the Golden Kingdom had ruled the stars since humanity's pilgrimage from our ancient homeworld.
									<br>
									<br>The various hued banners and colorful standards that it ruled were granted some sort of autonomy. As long as it sweared fealty to the benevolent Golden Crown.
									<br>
									<br>The Scarlet King was frustrated. His forefathers had planned this usurpation for centuries. Resentment had come to a head over the years and his court informed him that the time was right to strike.
									<br>
									<br>He walked absentmindedly past his knights to the throne of his rival. He wanted to avoid this. A quick capitulation is what his advisors and mystics foretold would happen. 
									<br>
									<br>His soldiers knew the winds of war were starting to blow. Some would never see the Homeworld again. 
									<br>
									<br>The banners would take sides and the stars would be ripped apart by the bloodshed to follow. 
									<br>
									<br>The Golden Kingdom had called his bluff and fled to the stars along with it's people. The king knew his reign would not be steady until those who may threaten it were dealt with.</p>
								<h2 class="major">END OF ALL THINGS | 25</h2>
								<!-- <span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
								<p>The Lights were worshiped by civilizations and beliefs of antiquity. 
									<br>
									<br>All held one indispensable truth across them all: those who made the pilgrimage never returned.  
								<h2 class="major">IMPACT | 100</h2>
								<!-- <span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
								<p>Briefings about space debris crashing to Earth weren't uncommon and no call for an emergency briefing with the president and the joint chiefs at a quarter past midnight.
									<br>
									<br>This one however terrified him and his colleagues at NASA. Word leaked from the agency it seemed as everyone from the Secret Service to the janitor looked uneasy.
									<br>
									<br>How do you explain that Voyager I, at last check 14.6 billion miles from Earth, now rests crashed in a crater in the South Lawn?
									<br>
									<br>Do I dare mention to them what was crudely carved into the metal carapace? A threat: To stay away.
								<h2 class="major">CAPES | 100</h2>
								<!-- <span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
								<p>Many think nukes are the weapons of mass destruction that we all should fear, they were just a cover for the real threat.
									<br>
									<br>Trinity was just a cover for Project: Atom-0. In the deserts of New Mexico we fused the power of the atom with the power of man. 
									<br>
									<br>Poor kid didn't know what was going to happen. I blame the suits and the eggheads all the way up to high command themselves.
									<br>
									<br>After we split the atom and fused it with the perfect soldier they all got greedy. And what happened after...what came after...that blood is on their hands.
